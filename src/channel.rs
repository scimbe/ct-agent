//! Agent Fabric — agent-side channel-join client (#72 AF4, ADR-0020).
//!
//! The counterpart to the edge broker's admission gate (`ct_edge::channel_broker`):
//! an agent that holds a `SignedChannelGrant` presents a [`ChannelJoinRequest`] to
//! the edge over QUIC and proves it holds the grant's `holder` private key, then
//! learns its paired peer's advertised endpoint. This module is the wire-protocol
//! client half; dialing the edge endpoint and custody of the channel key are the
//! caller's. (The broker is not yet mounted in the live edge — #81 SEC81c-c — so this
//! drives exactly the protocol the broker's own tests exercise.)
