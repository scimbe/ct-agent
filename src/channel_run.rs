//! Agent Fabric — the A2A channel *runner* (#72 AF4-session-wire, #98/#100).
//!
//! [`crate::channel`] rendezvouses two members and [`ct_common::a2a`] establishes the
//! Noise_IK session; this module is the piece that makes it *runnable*: given an
//! established QUIC connection, a role, and the Noise keys, it completes the A2A
//! handshake and then pumps a local byte stream (the CLI's stdin/stdout, or any
//! `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`) over the encrypted tunnel — a "netcat over the channel".
//! A thin `ct-agent` subcommand feeds it stdio; tests feed it an in-memory duplex.
