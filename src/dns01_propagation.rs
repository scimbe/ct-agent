//! Confirms a DNS-01 `_acme-challenge` TXT record is *publicly* resolvable
//! before telling the ACME server to validate it.
//!
//! A successful [`ct_dns::provider::Dns01Provider::set_txt`] call only proves
//! the control plane's DNS backend (e.g. deSEC) *accepted* the write — not
//! that it has replicated to the public-facing authoritative nameservers the
//! CA will actually query. Triggering validation before that replication
//! finishes is a real race (deSEC and most managed DNS backends have a short
//! but nonzero propagation delay), and once an ACME authorization is marked
//! `invalid` it cannot be retried — the client must start a fresh order. So
//! this self-checks via public DNS-over-HTTPS resolvers first, over HTTPS
//! (443), which stays reachable even on hosts that block outbound UDP/53.
//!
//! Queries more than one independent resolver operator (not just one): a
//! resolver that already answered NXDOMAIN for this exact query name (e.g.
//! from an earlier failed attempt at the same hostname) keeps serving that
//! cached negative answer for the zone's negative-cache TTL (the SOA
//! `minimum` field -- commonly up to an hour), regardless of whether the
//! authoritative data has since changed. A single retried hostname can very
//! plausibly have already been queried against the default resolver by an
//! earlier attempt; a second, independent resolver operator is unlikely to
//! share that exact cache poisoning.
//!
//! [`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`] has real margin built in on purpose: measured deSEC
//! propagation to a public resolver has ranged from ~10s up to just over 90s
//! across repeated live tests against the same zone -- a short timeout here
//! doesn't just risk a slower issuance, it risks the record briefly
//! *becoming* valid just after giving up, only for the caller's own
//! post-attempt cleanup (always run, success or failure -- see
//! `crate::acme_client::AcmeClient::validate_authorization`) to delete it
//! moments later, which from the outside looks indistinguishable from
//! "never published at all."
