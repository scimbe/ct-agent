//! Agent Fabric — the **libp2p connectivity seam** (#121 B2-libp2p-seam).
//!
//! This module introduces **libp2p** as the connectivity *substrate* underneath the
//! A2A channel. It is deliberately thin: libp2p supplies a raw, bidirectional byte
//! stream between two peers — over an in-process `MemoryTransport`
//! ([`connected_memory_stream_pair`], #121 B2-libp2p-seam), a real loopback TCP
//! socket ([`connected_tcp_stream_pair`], #121 B2-libp2p-tcp), or a **Circuit-Relay v2**
//! circuit through a third relay node ([`connected_relayed_stream_pair`], #121
//! C-circuit-relay-transport) — and our existing transport-agnostic session
//! ([`crate::channel_run::run_channel_session_on_stream`]) runs the `Noise_IK`
//! handshake + encrypted pump *inside* that stream.
//!
//! ## Trust boundary (the whole point of the seam)
//!
//! - **Invariant #1 — authorization stays our grant, never the libp2p `PeerId`.**
//!   The libp2p transport, its own connection-security (its Noise handshake), and the
//!   `PeerId` it authenticates are **untrusted plumbing**. Admission to a channel is
//!   decided *solely* by the operator-signed grant + the members' channel-attested
//!   Noise static keys, exactly as on every other transport. Nothing in this module
//!   consults the `PeerId` for authorization — it only names the dial target.
//! - **Invariant #2 — confidentiality/integrity are our `Noise_IK`, over the libp2p
//!   stream.** The bytes libp2p carries are already our end-to-end ciphertext; a
//!   compromised or malicious libp2p layer sees only that ciphertext.
//!
//! The Circuit-Relay v2 path ([`connected_relayed_stream_pair`]) proves the relay
//! *mechanism*: two peers reach each other through a third relay node and form the Noise
//! tunnel. The relay stood up here is deliberately **unguarded** — it relays any circuit —
//! which is safe **only** because it is test-only and in-process. Enforcing invariant #3
//! (a superpeer relays a circuit only for a channel it is a grant-member of) is the next
//! slice, `C-membership-gate`. **⚠️ This unguarded relay MUST NOT be wired to a
//! live/public relay node before the membership gate lands.**
//!
//! The DCUtR path ([`connected_dcutr_stream_pair`], #121 B2-dcutr) layers libp2p's
//! **Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay** ([`dcutr::Behaviour`]) onto the relay-client
//! swarms: once two peers are connected *through* the relay, DCUtR coordinates a **direct**
//! connection upgrade (the hole-punch), leaving the relay needed only for setup. This
//! module wires that machinery and proves — on **loopback**, where both peers are already
//! directly reachable, so the upgrade completes trivially or is a no-op — that enabling
//! DCUtR does **not** break the relayed `Noise_IK` session (invariants #1/#2 still hold).
//! The actual *cross-NAT* hole-punch (real NAT'd hosts, no direct reachability) cannot be
//! exercised on loopback and is verified by a **live** real-NAT test, not the cargo gate.
//!
//! The **Kademlia discovery** slice ([`kademlia_publish_and_resolve`], #121 D-kademlia) layers
//! a libp2p `kad` DHT onto the same tokio/TCP transport so a peer can *find* another peer's
//! reachability coordinates by [`ChannelId`] instead of being handed a multiaddr out of band.
//! The DHT record is a `ChannelId → coordinates` mapping whose **value is holder-signed**
//! ([`SignedCoordinateRecord`], **invariant #4**): the channel member signs
//! `domain || channel_id || holder || coordinates` with its ed25519 **holder** key, and a
//! reader **verifies that signature against the record's holder pubkey before trusting the
//! coordinates** ([`SignedCoordinateRecord::verified_coordinates`]). A poisoned record —
//! tampered coordinates or a substituted holder — fails verification and is rejected, so the
//! DHT (like the libp2p `PeerId`, invariant #1) is untrusted plumbing: trust flows only from
//! the holder signature, never from the DHT itself. Only the in-process, loopback-only
//! two-node put/get is exercised by the cargo gate; the real cross-host DHT bootstrap (a
//! central node seeded as the bootstrap peer) is a **live** step, not the cargo gate.
